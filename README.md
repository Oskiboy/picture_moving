# Picture Mover:

This is a simple script created to help my less tech-savvy mother to move her pictures from her memory card to her computer.

## Usage:

Download the main.py file. Make sure the memorycard is connected to the correct USB port or change it in the script and run it! It will use norwegian date names so change that if needed.
